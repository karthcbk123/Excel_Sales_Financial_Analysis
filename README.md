Sales & Finance Analytics for AtliQ Hardware


This project is an advanced-level data analytics project focused on Sales and Finance analytics for AtliQ Hardware, a company specializing in hardware and peripheral sales. The goal was to dive deep into sales data to generate key reports that would help the company improve its financial decision-making processes and monitor critical business KPIs.

Problem Overview


AtliQ Hardware works with several large clients such as Croma, Best Buy, Staples, and Flipkart, and its sales data is scattered across multiple sources and is highly unorganized. In this project, I worked with over half a million sales records, leveraging ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) techniques to organize and structure the data. The reports produced provide actionable insights into the company’s sales performance, customer behavior, and financial health. These insights empower AtliQ Hardware's management to make better strategic decisions and monitor their financial goals.

Objectives

The main objective of this project was to analyze the sales and financial data for AtliQ Hardware and create several insightful reports that would help the company understand their performance and make data-driven decisions.

The specific goals were to:

1- Clean and organize the sales data using ETL processes. 

2- Create performance reports for sales, customers, and markets. 

3- Identify key performance trends in terms of sales growth, product performance, and profitability. 

4- Help the company improve its net sales, gross margin, and overall financial health.




Data Preparation



The project involved cleaning and transforming the data using ETL processes:

Extract:-  Extracted raw data from various sources like CSV and Excel files.

Transform:- Cleaned and transformed the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and aggregating it in a structured format.

Load:- Loaded the transformed data into Excel where further analysis could take place. I used Power Pivot to model the data and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for creating calculated columns and measures. These techniques allowed me to build interactive reports that can be used for decision-making.




Sales Report :

1. Create a [customer Performance Report](https://github.com/karthcbk123/Excel_Sales_Financial_Analysis/blob/main/Customer%20Performance%20Report.pdf)
2.

Key Insights and Learnings


Throughout this project, I learned the value of data-driven decision-making and gained practical experience in working with large datasets.

Here are the key insights:

1- Business Opportunity Discovery: I learned how business analysts uncover opportunities by analyzing historical data and identifying key trends.

2- Project Priority Matrix: I created a project priority matrix that helps project managers prioritize their tasks based on business impact and effort. This is crucial for improving project management efficiency.

3- Importance of ETL Processes: I recognized the significant role ETL processes play in preparing data for analysis. Proper data cleaning, transformation, and structuring ensure accurate and meaningful analysis.

4- Pivot Tables & Power Pivot: I enhanced my understanding of Pivot Tables for summarization and Power Pivot for advanced data modeling. These tools enable efficient summarization, sorting, and analysis, making it easier to generate reports and dashboards.

5- Conditional Formatting: The use of Conditional Formatting was vital in highlighting key data points, such as identifying high/low values, growth trends, and deviations from targets. This enhances the clarity of reports.

6- Real-Life Data Projects: Working on real-life data projects like this one helped me better understand how to apply theoretical knowledge to practical situations and deliver impactful business insights.

Conclusion
This project was a fantastic opportunity to work with real-world sales and finance data. It allowed me to apply advanced Excel, and ETL techniques to solve business problems and generate actionable insights. By analyzing sales performance, customer behavior, and financial health, AtliQ Hardware is better equipped to make informed decisions and improve its overall business performance.
